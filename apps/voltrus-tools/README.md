# Voltrus Tools

Industrial protocol tools in one native window, built with Rust and
[GPUI](https://gpui.rs) (Zed's GPU UI framework). Every frame is drawn on the
GPU, so live trends scroll at your display's refresh rate.

It shares the protocol crates in [`../../crates`](../../crates) with the
standalone Tauri apps in this repository.

## What it does

- **Modbus master**, TCP or RTU: register blocks of any area and type, word
  order, polling with automatic reconnect, writes to coils and holding
  registers, latency and error counters.
- **Modbus simulator**: serves a device template (SMA inverter, Schneider
  PM5560, Endress+Hauser flowmeter, ABB analyser, Emerson Daniel flow
  computer, Raritan PDU) or a plain register image of up to 2000 registers.
  Template values drift realistically; a value set from the app or written by
  any master is held until released.
- **MQTT client** (on `mt-mqtt`): host and port, client id, username and
  password, TLS against the system's trust store, keep-alive, wildcard
  subscriptions with QoS. Every concrete topic becomes a point: a number,
  true/false, each numeric field of a JSON payload (or only the one at a JSON
  path such as `phases[0].v`), or each Sparkplug B metric with its unit (a
  missed birth is re-requested). Raw messages go to traffic, broker events to
  the log; the inspector shows the last message and publishes any payload with
  QoS and retain, and writing a point publishes to its topic.
- **MQTT broker simulator**: a broker on this computer that publishes a
  device template as retained numbers at `<prefix>/<value>`, a JSON nameplate
  at `<prefix>/status` and optionally a Sparkplug B edge node. A number
  published to a value's topic (or `<topic>/set`) by any client is held.
- **BACnet/IP client**: a device picker that sends Who-Is (broadcast on the
  BACnet port, and directed at an address and at the simulators on this
  computer) and lists the devices that answer with their instance, vendor and
  address. The client reads the device's object list and shows every analog,
  binary and multi-state input, output and value with its object name and
  units, subscribes to change-of-value notifications where the device takes
  them and polls the rest with ReadPropertyMultiple (ReadProperty for devices
  without it). A fault status flag marks the value bad; alarm and override
  flags are logged. Writes are WriteProperty commands at the connection's
  priority, and **Relinquish** writes NULL to give the command up. The local
  address and UDP port are configurable (0.0.0.0:47808 to receive
  broadcasts).
- **BACnet device simulator**: plays an air handler, a chiller or a VAV box
  on any UDP port. It answers Who-Is, ReadProperty(Multiple), WriteProperty
  with a 16-level priority array, and SubscribeCOV. A value set from the app
  or commanded by any client is held until released or relinquished.
- **Siemens S7 client** (on `mt-s7`, ISO-on-TCP): host and port, rack and
  slot (with S7-1200/1500, S7-300 and S7-400 presets) and the PDU size to
  ask for. Tags are addresses as engineers write them (`DB1.DBD0`,
  `DB1.DBX4.0`, `MW20`, `I0.3`, `QB2`, `T5`, `C10`, `%`-prefixed or German
  `E`/`A`/`Z` too), validated as you type, read as Bool, Byte, Word, Int,
  DWord, DInt, Real, String, Timer (ms) or Counter, packed into as few
  requests as the negotiated PDU allows. A tag the CPU refuses (a missing DB)
  goes bad on its own and is logged; the rest keep reading. Writes are checked
  against the type before they go out. The **PLC** view (⌘5) shows the CPU's
  identity (module, order number, firmware, serial, station), its operating
  mode, the diagnostic buffer newest first and every block by type; ⌘R reads
  it again.
- **S7 PLC simulator** (`mt-s7`'s server): plays an S7-1500 motor drive, an
  S7-300 reactor or an S7-1200 packaging line on any TCP port, with data
  blocks, inputs, outputs, markers, timers, counters and strings, a CPU
  identity, diagnostic buffer and block list. A value set from the app or
  written by any client is held until released.
- **Live points**: every value with its Modicon address, name, unit, type, raw
  words and a sparkline of the last minute. Clients of a simulated template
  get its register names and units. Columns drop out as a pane narrows.
- **Trends**: multi-series charts of the points you pick, 30 s to 15 min.
  Series of very different size (watts beside hertz) get stacked lanes, each
  with its own scale.
- **Traffic and log**: a master's requests and responses with their payload
  words, a BACnet client's requests, answers and COV notifications, an S7
  client's and simulator's PDUs with their addresses and item results, the
  requests a simulator receives, and every connect, failure and external
  write. Both follow new entries until you scroll back or pause.
- **Tabs and splits**: watch a device and its simulator side by side, or two
  views of one session. Layout and connections are restored on launch.
- **Command palette** (⌘K) and 492 colour schemes with live preview.

Modbus, MQTT, BACnet and S7 are ported. The others in this repository (OPC UA,
EtherNet/IP, DNP3, NATS, serial, BLE) are being ported next; each plugs into
the same engine and views ([how](docs/architecture.md#adding-a-protocol)).

## Try it

Start the app and press **Start demo plant**: a simulated inverter opens next
to a client polling it (each protocol on the welcome screen has its own
**Demo**). Or run a fixed scenario without touching your saved workspace:

```bash
cargo run -p vt-app --release -- --demo points   # welcome, points, trend, traffic,
                                                 # simulator, editor, palette, light,
                                                 # mqtt-points, mqtt-trend, mqtt-traffic,
                                                 # mqtt-inspector, mqtt-editor
                                                 # bacnet-points, bacnet-trend,
                                                 # bacnet-traffic, bacnet-discover,
                                                 # bacnet-command, s7-points, s7-trend,
                                                 # s7-traffic, s7-plc, s7-write, s7-editor
```

Demo scenarios use the dark house theme (`light` the light one) whatever the
system appearance, so screenshots are comparable.

## Build

GitHub Actions builds, tests and bundles every push
([workflow](../../.github/workflows/voltrus-tools.yml)): download
`voltrus-tools-macos-arm64` and the screenshots from the run.

Locally (needs a few GB for GPUI's build):

```bash
cd apps/voltrus-tools
cargo test --workspace
cargo build --release -p vt-app
scripts/bundle-macos.sh target/release/voltrus-tools dist
```

Linux needs the usual GPUI libraries (`libxkbcommon`, `libwayland`, `libvulkan`,
`libfontconfig`) and `libudev` for serial ports.
